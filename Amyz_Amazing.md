This is Amy's amazing taco recipe.
It's good on a cold day.
Take 1 taco shell.
Warm it in toaster oven at 250 for 4 minutes.
Don't get distracted or it will burn and be wrecked.
While it's cooking, search through fridge for:
     any veggies good raw
     any veggies needing cooking
     a protein or two
     some sauce
Remove taco shell from toaster
Layer ingredients.
Put veggies that need cooking back in the fridge.
Who has time?
